# Hi 👋 I'm Ayla Nasir

## 💫 About Me:
• I'm interested in where engineering and business intersect<br>• I find finance and consulting super interesting, while also enjoying exploring the tech world<br>• I love learning new skills, meeting people of all walks of life, and seeing how I can leverage my skills and passions to positively contribute to the world around me<br>

## 🎨 Interests:
• I love visual arts and graphic design, and I’ve recently been exploring Figma in my spare time.<br>
• I enjoy traveling (like most people), but my favorite part is capturing moments through photography. ✈️📷<br>
• My love for STEM and reading began with the nonfiction books I read as a child, and it still drives my curiosity today. I’m currently reading Quantum Physics Made Me Do It by Jeremie Harris.<br>
